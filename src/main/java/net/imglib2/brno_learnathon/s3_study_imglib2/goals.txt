exploring goodies from the imglib2:

Views & Interpolation,
(fasten image processing with ROIS... via Views.Interval())


Views - abstract image with on-demand, on-the-fly computed values,
       typically constructed over some "normal image",

		 they basically hide away the "technicalities" of
		 the on-the-fly computing allowing the programmer to focus
		 on the actual work with the image, getting a pixel
		 value should be done "simply like always" - convenience

Popular use-cases:

- extending the image with certain boundary while preserving
its iterability domain... sweeps over the original image but
can fetch pixels from outside

(example that interval and getting values is not firmly connected..
Views.extend/expand... Saalfeld larger image with no data and exception thrown)

- multiple views on the same image for parallel sweeping

- limiting the view, setting up a ROI, or removing/permuting the dimensions

- turing RAI into II (adding iterability)


explore yourself
what's the difference between expand and extend?
