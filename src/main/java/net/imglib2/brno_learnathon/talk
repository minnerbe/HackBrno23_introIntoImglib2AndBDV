imglib2

for images - either backed by arrays, or generated, or combined
includes also related data types such as points, labels, etc

but not focused solely on images!

aims for a great deal of flexibility
- interfaces everywhere -- plugable implementations
- fine-control over functionality -- slim ifaces,
                             cascades of them, layers (of onion)

- generics used (as no surprise)

lazy paradigm
