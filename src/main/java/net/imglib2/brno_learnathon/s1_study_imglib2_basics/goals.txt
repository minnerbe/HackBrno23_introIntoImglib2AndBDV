------------------

create image
read-in image from drive
show image

pixel types
familiarize with generics

access pixels, set pixels
either selectively, or iterate all of them
notice the dimensionality pattern

realize the two regime, have functions with such (limited) params
speaking of iterability: we talk about images that are bounded or not
speaking of random access (but not necessarily only it):
                     - we talk abour integer and real coordinates
                     - (this will be further elaborated later with the Views,
                        for now be aware that it is possible in imglib2)

what helps: don't take the names for granted,
they're long not to annoy one, but to help

these are the "building blocks":

Iterable -- something you can visit one be one, in "some" order,
            being sure you don't visit the same spot twice,
				but does not allow to jump to any spot, doesn't offer a choice

Accessible -- can visit any spot,
            consequence: can visit all spots but in one's own order

Real      -- The grid coordinates naturally integer one (discrete),
            this accepts to query real (continuous) coordinates,
				depends on the backend and setting of the Real* object
				what policy it employs to provide the facilitate the caller

Interval  -- the coordinates of *Interval have min,max bounds in all dimensions
