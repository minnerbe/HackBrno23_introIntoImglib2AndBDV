mirrors 1/goals

but while 1/goals was showing how-to,
here (2/goals) is a bit of understand/realize details while trying yourself
------------------

create image from one's own float array
clone image and save it

do you need float type only?
can you generalize also for (all flavours of) ints and doubles?

watchout (avoid) for fixed-dimensionality loop patterns
localizableCursor (instead of setting positions and moving accessor)

there are various ifaces used for positioning, you can avoid localize() and setPositioj()
make sweeping of tgt image follow the src img
avoid getXYZ() unless used very occasionally

understand iteratation subtleties of various backends
is setPosition(localize()) ideal? when and which memory locations does it visit?
isn't it better to clone() image to warrant the same backend and just sweep two cursors?

caches... advanced thing... "vertical sweep in parallel"
