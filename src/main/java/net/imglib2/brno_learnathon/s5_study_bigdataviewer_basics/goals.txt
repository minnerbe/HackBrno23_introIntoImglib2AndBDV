possible topics to cover:
------------------

Theory & features:
- Theory aka “What makes it possible”: Remind of blocks and resolutions
- plus goodies that make great UX like loading low-res and high-res in another thread  later (to have the image “cleared” a little later)
- Can display many sources… 
- Backed by imglib2…. Backends allow for various data fetching schemes

- How to open my image (e.g. TIFF) in BDV? What pixel types are supported?
- How to massage my images to accommodate what theory said (blocks and res.levels)?
- What is view setup? Why is there some .xml file always around?
- I have heard of HDF5, N5, Zarr, NGFF… are all the same?


- What controls do I have? Main window? Some side bar? Scale bar? Legend?
- Scale bar has some interesting icons… what are fused/single/group views? How do I define a group?
- All is dark? I don’t see anything? What are the sliders for?
- Why do I have Brightness & Contrast dialog, and the side bar? Do they control the same thing?

- How is the view handled with a mouse? With a keyboard? It doesn’t work like Blender… ;) it rotates weirdly/widely
- Can I zoom in? slow/fast? Restore axis-aligned views (e.g. shift+z)? Bookmarks (revisiting previous view angle)?


- Overview/help dialog… the Controls panel is great for this (plus you can have control profiles!.. .e.g. To make it navigate napari-style, blender-style)
- Can I share my favourite controls setup with a friend (aka copy settings files around, and where these files are on my drive?)

Programmer perspective:
- Is there any public API? Examples?
